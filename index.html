    <h2><u>What is in this club?</u></h2>
    <p>
        1) Making science projects and doing robotics, share your different ideas about what you want to build or design( My initial idea is making drones. Anyone else can share about their own ideas or opinions about what they want to do if he/she joins this club). Go Dutch if we’re buying any supplies

       2) Math help: So if you have any math questions for your homework, SAT, PSAT etc. you are willing to come here and ask the club members or me if us are available. You don’t actually have to join this club for getting math help, but that can’t be better that if you join the club.And also when you have your questions done, please support us with the "financial issues"
